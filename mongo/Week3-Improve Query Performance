# Replace "YYYY" with the best index to increase the performance of the two queries above
people.create_index("last_name")

Answer : last_name

Explaination:
The second part of the lab requires a bit more thinking.

Recall from the lesson that indexes increase the speed of queries that use the fields specified in the index.

After examining both queries you should have noticed that both filter on last_name. This is a prime candidate to create and index on to increase the performance of these two queries.

people.create_index('last_name')
