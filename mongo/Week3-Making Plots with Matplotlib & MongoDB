Question 1 : 

Answer : Choice 4


Question 2: 
# here you'll write the code to plot pressures and air_temps in a cartesian plot
plt.clf()

fig , ax = plt.subplots()

ax.scatter(pressures,air_temps)

plt.show()

Answer : Choice 2

Question 3:

# here you'll write the code to plot pressures, air_temps, and wind_speeds in a 3D plot

plt.clf()

fig = plt.figure()

ax = fig.add_subplot(111 , projection = '3d')

ax.scatter(pressures,air_temps,wind_speeds)


Answer : Choice 4


Question 4 : 
# here you'll write the code to trip durations for each day as box plots

plt.clf()

fig , ax = plt.subplots()

ax.boxplot(trip_durations_by_day)

plt.show()


Answer : Choice 3
